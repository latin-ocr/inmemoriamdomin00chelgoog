60. The complexes considered in the soregoing arts. may be
generated by a second, and equally fruitlul method. The latter
being derivable from the former by the Principle ol Duality, howe-
ver, a simple enunciation ol the following theorem will suffice:

Tlre intersections of a pair os conjugale planes, in two corre-

lative pencils (Α) arrd (B), form a complex of tlte second degree
whose singular surface breaks up into, 1⁰ llre troo centres A, B of tlte
pencr'ls, 2⁰ rte two sels-conjugare planes pl, γ, and 3⁰ tlte quadric
S ² locus of tlte r'rrtersections of pairs of 'incident conjugale lines. The
two first constituents are ‹ausgrreiclmete ι points and planes ol
the complex, and the third is touched by all the proper singular ·

lines ol the complex, which latter present themselves as intersec-
tions ol the pairs oi planes which correspond to incident conju·
gate lines.

' The complex 0 considered in the last two arto. is identicnl with that
brielly described by Wciler in art. 45 (A) ol his Memoir (loc. cit, p. 198).
