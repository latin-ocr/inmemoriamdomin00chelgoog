viz. he seeks for solutions osan equation of this form which also
satissy a certain differentia} equation of the third order. The
coefficients a, b, c are either all arbitrary‚ or they are two or one
os them, arbitra1y; but this last case (or say the case where the
sunction os x is the completely determinate function κ’ -Ι- sz -}-c)
is scarcely considered: α’, b', c' are regarded as determinable in
terms of a, b, c; and z is to be found as a sunction os x indepen-
dentosa, b, c: so that when these coefficients are arbitrary, the
equation breaks up into three equations, and when two of the coef-
ficients are arbitrary‚ it breaks up into two equations‚ satisfied in
each case by the same value of z; and the vaiue oi z is thus de·
termined without any integration: these cases will be considered in
the sequel, but they are of course included in the general case where
the coefficients a, b, c are regarded as having any given valucs
whatever.
