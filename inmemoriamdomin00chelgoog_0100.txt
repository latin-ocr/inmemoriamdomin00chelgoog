GENERATION, AND PROPERTIES OF THE GENERAL COMPLEX.

r. From the general definition* ol a correlation between two
planes α, β it follows that if the linea corresponding, in the for·
mer, toa point B in the latter, pass through any point A then,
conversely, the line b corresponding to A will pass through B. Two
points A, Β so situated are termed conjiegate points ol the corre·
lative planes. In like manner two lines a, b in these planes, are
said to be conjugate lines when either, and consequently each, con-
tains the point which corresponds to the other.

2. Each point ol one ol the two planes α, β being conjugate
to every point in its corresponding line, the total number of pairs
of conjugate points in α and β will be triply infinite, and tlte laires
which, individually, pass through two conjugate points will constitute
a complex 0.

1 propose to consider the complexes which may be thus ge·
nerated. Their nature and singularities will, clearly, depend upon
those ol the correlation es'tablished between the planes, as well as
upon the relative positione of the latter. Unless the contrary is di·
stinctly stated, however, no exceptional character is to be as·
signed to the correlation or special positione to the correlated
planes,
