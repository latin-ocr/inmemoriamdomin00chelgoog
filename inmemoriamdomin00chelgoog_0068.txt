which, observing that (zx-l- 2)² —X= 3(x- 1)², may also be written

and I wish to show that this is in fact the particular integral belong·

ing to the value C =1 of the constant of integration: for this
purpose Ι proceed to rationalise the general integral as regards 2.
Writing sor a moment

we have
P²=—(1,66 10232180102 66„,1]{21)

Q²= (1, 42, 591, 2828, 591, 42, 1152,ss
and thence
P2-Q²=(0,—108,432,-648,432,—108,03[2, 1)⁰,

P² ÷ Q² =2 (1, — 12, 807, 2504, 807,- 12,1][z,1)⁶.
' Writing the equation rn the form
