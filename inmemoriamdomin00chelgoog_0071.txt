Α. Cayley,

The example shows that although the differential equation

· ziz-n xlx-1)

can be integrated generally in a quasi-algebraical or algebraical

sorni as above, yet we cannot from the general solution deduce,
at once or easily, the various particular intcgrals comprised therein:
nor can we find sor what values of the constants a, b,c and α’, b', c'
the differential equation admits of a simple solution, or say os a
solution where z is expressed as an explicit (irrational) fonction ol x.

In the cases considered by Kummer there is a second (or it
may be also a third) differential equation ol the like form, the equa·
tions being each of them satisfied by the same value ol z: hence

eliminating the differentials dx, dz, the relation between x and r is
of the form ·
P' - P
o- a

' where P, Q are quadric fonctions ol ιη Ρ, Q' quadric fonctions

ol a. But P and Qmay contain acommon lactor, and the inte·

¹gral is then expressible in the form x = Z, the quotient of two

Q

quadric fonctions ol κς or P' and ρ’ may have a common factor,

and the integral is then expressible in the lorm z= R, the quo·

tient of two quadric fonctions ol x; or there may be a common fac·

gral is then ol the form p: —

M, the quotient ol two linear fonctions

of x.

In the general case the differential equation is
