containing the three arbitrary constante a, b, c; λ is a constant the

velue of which can be at once determined.

There are in all 6 integrals ol the form z :Agr ior which the
differential equation contains three arbitrary constants: 18 integrals

ol the form z=-P (and of course the same number ol integrals os

the form τεῦ), and 9 integrals of the form 5:327, lor all ol
which the differential equation contains 2arbitrary constants. It is
to be remarked that Kummer‚ considering the values oi z as a sunc-
tion os x, obtains the 72 rational and irrational values mentioned in
his equations (31), (35), (36), (37), (38), and (39): but the 72 values arc
made up as follows, viz. the 18 values osz as a rational sunction
of x, the 36 irrational valucs obtained srorn the 18 expressions ol x
as a rational function oi 2, and the 18 irrational values of z obtained
from the9 integrals in which neither ol the variables is a rational
fonction ol the other: 18 -Ι- 36-l- 18:72.

The several integrals together with the expressions ol the sunc-

tions a'z¹ -l- 2ὐέ † c' and ax² ΑΓ 2bx†c which enter into the dis·
serential equation are as follows.
