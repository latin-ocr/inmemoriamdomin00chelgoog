where D is the product oi any number n of distinct linear iactors
x - p, and N is a rational and integral iunction oi x oi the order n
at most, and therefore also the integral

pti-333:

D

where N is now os the order n—2 at most, is expressible as the
logarithm oi a quasi-algebraicai iunction, that is a iunction containing

powers the exponents of which are incommensurable (ior instance aff
is a quasi-algebraical iunction): in fact the integral is of the iorm

hence if we have a differential equation

where Z ' (= a'z² † 2 b'z -Ι- c‘), and N'‚ D' are iunctions oi z such
as X‚N,D are oi x; then taking log C ior the constant oi integra·

the quasi-algebraical integral Ω’ - C Ω =0.

The constants a, b, c, p, q, . .. etc. may be such that the expo·
