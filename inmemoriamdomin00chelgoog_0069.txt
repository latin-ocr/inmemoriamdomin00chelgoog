This is a sextio equation in ε, of the form

is o denote the fonction os x which enters into the equation3 and
writing z -l-{—= 6, this becomes

0³-30†t(t²-2)†p.6÷v=0.
But the equation in z is satisfied by the value z= x, and therefore

the equation in 0 by the value 6 -- x ψ ἑ , = α suppose, we have

therefore

and thence subtracting, and throwing out the factor 0-α,
